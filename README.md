## Wat?
Basically a auto-completion system that gives an average number of inputs given to obtain a word, from a dataset file.
## File structure
- `etc` is for external resources (images, video, audio, etc.). The dataset files are on `etc`
- `src` is for source code
- `doc` is for documentation
- `lib` is for putting libraries. ex: lib/foo/[*.c,*.h]
- `README.md` is a general README file
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is basically a FAQ for contributors
- `Makefile` is for use with `make`
